# krosshair - Crosshair Overlay for Games on Linux

* Works with **Steam and non-Steam games**.
* Works on **native and Flatpak** installations (e.g. Bazitte / Steam Deck / SteamOS).

# Demo
Screenshot showing the default crosshair. To use a different crosshair place one of the files in repo dir `crosshairs` at `~/.config/crosshair-maker/projects/current.png` or use env var `KROSSHAIR_IMG` to load it from a different location.

# Installation

## Non-Flatpak Installation

## Option 1: Via Arch Linux AUR

```bash
yay -S krosshair
```

## Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noahlyk/krosshair.git
cd krosshair
make install
```

## Flatpak Installation

Necessary if your games (and apps like Steam / Lutris / Heroic) run via Flatpak. This is for example the case on Bazzite and other immutable Linux distributions. 

### Option 1: Download Github Release
- Download **all** .flatpack files from the [releases page](https://github.com/noahlyk/krosshair/releases).
- Install via double-clicking the file in your file manager (or run `flatpak install (--user) filename.flatpak` in your terminal).


### Option 2: Build from Source

Builds and installs Flatpak bundles for the supported runtime versions (24.08, 25.08, 26.08).

```bash
sudo pacman -S flatpak-builder
git clone https://github.com/noahlyk/krosshair.git
cd krosshair
make flatpak-install
```

# Usage

## Steam Games

Add the follwoing launch option:

```
KROSSHAIR=1 %command%
```

To use a custom crosshair (from the `crosshairs` dir of this repo):

```
KROSSHAIR=1 KROSSHAIR_IMG=/optional/path/to/crosshair.png %command%
```

## Other Games

```bash
export KROSSHAIR=1
#export KROSSHAIR_IMG=/path/to/crosshair.png # To use a custom crosshair (from the `crosshairs` dir of this repo)
your-game
```

# Make your own crosshairs using `crosshair-maker`

krosshair works out of the box with [crosshair-maker](https://github.com/noahlyk/crosshair-maker), a crosshair overlay creator with SVG rendering and preview. The currently selected crosshair is automatically exported to `~/.config/crosshair-maker/projects/current.png`, which krosshair picks up as its default — just launch your game with `KROSSHAIR=1` and go.

Use `export KROSSHAIR_IMG=/path/to/crosshair.png` to use a specific crosshair file.

To test the full setup together with `vkcube`:

```sh
$ yay -Sy krosshair crosshair-maker vulkan-tools
$ KROSSHAIR=1 vkcube &
$ crosshair-maker &
```

# FAQ / Various

## Can i get banned for this?
I don't know, use at your own risk. I've only used it in Quake Champions and STRAFTAT, both of which don't really have an anticheat.

## Issues
As of now, the overlay leaks a bit of memory everytime you alt-tab out of/into the game, as well as everytime the window is being resized and upon resolution changes. It's not a big leak and shouldn't cause any problems, but it's still worth noting.
I've tried fixing it multiple times but have always hit a dead-end. If someone more experienced with vulkan wants to help, take a look at [this issue](https://github.com/krob64/krosshair/issues/1). I know it's a bit of a mess, this whole project is based on a morally questionable apex legends project which i'm unsure if i should link to it here, coupled with me jumping into it right after completing the vulkan tutorial.
